            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>You can't force someone to fall in love with you, but you can definitely improve your odds. If you see my wife again, you tell her I love her... she's my hummingbird. Well, Baby O, it's not exactly mai-tais and Yahtzee out here â€” but let's do it. A toast? Yeah. To high treason. That's what these men were committing when they signed the Declaration. Put the bunny, back in the box...
                I believe it's warlord. I'm ready, ready for the big ride, baby! Unless you're a 20 year old guitarist from Seattle. It's a grunge thing. Where there's a will, there's a weapon. I drive a Volvo, a beige one. But what I'm dealing with here is one of the most deadly substances the Earth has ever known, so what say you cut me some friggin' slack?</p>
